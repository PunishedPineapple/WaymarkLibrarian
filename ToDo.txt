***** TODO LIST *****

High Priority:

- Why are character directory last modified times being updated, but then only sometimes?  May be related to copying a backup of the UISAVE?
- Try to see if the UISAVE.DAT header contains a file format version that can be used instead of hoping that file length is a good enough discriminator.
- Dictionary is a most likely poor choice for the underlying data structure in the zone dictionary since we want to be able to access by index as well.  Maybe keep two lists and manage them ourselves?


Low Priority / Cleanup:

- Have some kind of simple first-run tutorial?  Explain basic functionality (including how character should be logged out before reading/saving).
- Use zone name as preset name when copying to library instead of character name and slot (maybe have character name in parentheses after it?).
- It feels super janky having web stuff and especially popup dialogs in the config classes.  See about making that stuff less of a mess.
- Config classes are kind of a mess overall.
- Clean up code formatting as much as reasonably possible.
- Keep looking for ways to get character name from configuration data.
- See if there is a good way to get duty names from zone names so that the zone dictionary looks a bit better.
- Fix any wonky tab indices.  Maybe leave space between groups of indices for future expansion.
- Handle big-endian architectures in the ReadBytes and WriteBytes function.
- Maybe check for identical presets in the library when adding a new one, but maybe not.
- It would be nice to set the selection back on the updated preset in the library, but that's kind of hard if we're sorting after updating.  See what we can do.
- Can the Newtonsoft JSON dll be packaged in with the executable easily?  Probably need to wait until the .net core WinForms designer is added.  ILMerge seems like a bad idea, and Costura (Fody) seems a bit sketchy with being supported.
- Make the waymark and preset get string methods be ToString.  Actually maybe not; does all that formatted information make sense as a simple "ToString" call?  Maybe it does for the individual waymark, since that's a one-line thing.


Very Low Priority / Potential New Features:

- Maybe have copy to game bring up a context menu of which slot to use instead of relying on having a slot selected?  Maybe just make a copy to slot context menu in the library list instead?
- Have date in zone dictionary with release date for each zone and restrict to that?
- Prompt user before switching character or closing program if there are unwritten changes?
- Possibly add a quick waymark generator that takes an arena center and adds evenly spaced x number of waymarks at a given radius.
- Add a "Sync to Library" button that overwrites only the coordinates/active flags in the library with the ones from the game (if the zones match).
